# Smart Waste Sorter

A full-stack project to develop a mobile application that uses a phone's camera and an image classification model to identify waste as recyclable, compostable, or landfill-bound.

## Project Structure

This repository is a monorepo containing two main parts:
-   **`backend/`**: A Python Flask server that communicates with the **Azure Custom Vision** prediction API.
-   **`frontend/smart-waste-sorter-app/`**: A React Native mobile app built with Expo.

## Getting Started

Backend: backend/python server.py

Frontend: frontend/smart-waste-sorter-app/npx expo start
