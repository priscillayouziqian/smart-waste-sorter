# Smart Waste Sorter

A project to develop a mobile application that uses a phone's camera and an image classification model to identify waste as recyclable, compostable, or landfill.

This repository currently contains the Python client for interacting with the prediction endpoint of a model trained and hosted on **Azure Custom Vision**.

## Features

-   **Image Classification**: Identifies waste from a local image file.
-   **Cloud-Powered AI**: Utilizes a custom model trained and hosted on Microsoft Azure Custom Vision.
-   **Simple API Client**: A Python script (`model_api.py`) to easily test the model's predictions.
